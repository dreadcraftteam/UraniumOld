## Uranium (Rewrite branch)
This is an 3D game engine written in C using SDL, STB and Glad. This engine is devided into modules for ease of working and security. Also, the engine is still at a VERY early stage of development, so I do not recommend creating large projects on it. If you find an error or bug, please report it to the [issues](https://github.com/dreadcraftteam/Uranium/issues) section.

## Wiki
Coming soon.
